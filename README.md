Just think about your Facebook or Twitter network,where you and your FB friends are the nodes of the network, and all of you connect to each other. A group on FB is somehow the same as a hub, where people with the same interest gather (the hub in the name Github gives the same meaning :>). So the assortativity is to see how well people are connected with a specific features in a specific network, for example in my university our FB network you can find group for specific department, like 'PMAB Gen 7' - my department, so  the assortativity for 'PMAB Gen 7' feature is high among my friends in PMAB department.


For understanding better the network, I invite you to go to this website, where my colleagues and my supervisor are working on the visualization of the assortativity in the network of chromatin: https://pancaldi.bsc.es/garden-net/#/
